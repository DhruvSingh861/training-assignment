Expected Output:-
Above provided key-value pairs should be stored and
HashMap should be printed when we select 4 from menu.
number of collisions should be 4.

Expected Output:-
Above provided key-value pairs should be stored and value of key 49 should be updated from 490 to 10000.
HashMap should be printed when we select 4 from menu.
number of collisions should be 3. (updation of value of key 49 should not be counted as collision.)
